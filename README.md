# WildLens

### Description:
An animal prediction website, powered by cutting-edge technology and deep learning! This website allows you to upload an image of an animal, and its model will accurately predict the species it belongs to.

Using a ***Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)***, a type of deep learning model renowned for its exceptional image classification capabilities, this system is trained on a vast dataset of animal images. Once you upload your image, the model processes it through multiple layers of convolution, pooling, and classification, ultimately delivering a prediction with remarkable accuracy.

### Technologies Used:
* ***Frontend***: Built with React and Vite for a fast, responsive user interface.
* ***Backend***: Powered by Flask to handle image uploads and predictions.
* ***Deep Learning***: The backbone of the prediction system is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a large set of animal images.

### How It Works:
* ***Upload Image***: Simply select or drag and drop an image of an animal from your device.
* ***Prediction***: Once uploaded, our model will analyze the image and predict the species.
* ***Result Displayed***: In just a few seconds, the predicted animal species will be shown on your screen.

### Key Features:
* ***Simple Image Upload***: Easily upload an image of any animal, and our website takes care of the rest.
* ***Real-time Predictions***: Receive immediate predictions on the species of the uploaded animal.
* ***Powered by CNN***: Our model uses a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network to ensure high accuracy in classifying animal species based on their visual features.
* ***User-friendly Interface***: The website offers a clean, easy-to-use interface that makes predicting animal species a breeze for everyone.
